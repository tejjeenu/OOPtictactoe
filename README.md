# OOP TicTacToe

intention was to understand OOP concepts through this, its in interactive tictactoe which can use object or hand movements to play tictactoe on a computer,
but the JAVA code was created with OOP principles, it also has a UI in python which controls settings like colours of a lamp to indicate the player's turn
